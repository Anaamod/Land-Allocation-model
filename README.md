This is a model of land use allocation and harvest dynamics. The land is divided into agricultural, primary forest (natural forest) and secondary forest (plantation). 
The secondary forest grows following a logistic function of forest density.
This makes the dynamic optimization non linear.
You can find two sets of intital values : EU file is a region with very low primary forest area and SA is a region with high primary forest area.
